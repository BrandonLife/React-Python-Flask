<h1>Flask/React Tutorial Project</h1>

<h1>What is this project about?</h1>
<p>This is a simple react project that uses python and flask to display an array of members onto the screen</p>

<h1>What issues did you encounter?</h1>
<p>Even though this was a guided tutorial, i found myself really struggling with creating a virtual environment. This is due to the fact i have four environments along with Pycharm installed so its creating conflicts when i try to choose a Python intrepete to create the environment. I ended up using a global Python interpreter on my machine to fix the problem but i still need to find a way to get rid of the other environments from other projects. </p>
